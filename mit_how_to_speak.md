It is pretty easy to get distracted by a working laptop even if it is not yours.


Usually a quality of speech depends on several parameters like knowledge (most), practicing with the knowledge and a talent of the speakers (least).

### How To Start

* Sometimes speakers start with some joke. Not recommended because the audience is getting adjusted to your talk right now and is not ready for a joke.

* It would make sense to start with some empowerment promise. E.g.: By the end of the talk you will be able to do that and that thing.



### Euristics

* Cycle on some subject several times (usually three) because at some moment part of the audience will be out of context.

* Build a fence around your ideas so there would be a context of the talk and there would be no confusion with other ideas.

* Verbal punctuation. People will be out of context so we could set some landmark in our talks. E.g. the number of ideas/heuristics in this talks.

* Ask **properly prepared** questions in your talk so the audience could get back on track. It should be **properly prepared** so the audience would not feel embarassed or awkward.


### Time and place

* The perfect time is 11am. People are awake completely, there is still a time before lunch, people can concentrate on the talk.

* The place should be well-lit because otherwise people would receive a signal to sleep.

* The place should be cased so the speaker could be prepared to be able to deal with some extraordinary stuff.

* The place should be reasonably populated. Not too small count, so the audience would not consider changing the talk for the other one, preliminary more interesting. Not too large so it would be comfortable to listen to the talk. Somewhere between half-full room and completely packed room.


### Board

* Slides are good for giving information. When you use black-/whiteboard you can properly **teach**

* It is easier to use graphics with a board

* It is easier to keep up with the audience when you use a board. Slides are too fast.

* Board can be a target. Hands are at everyone's site, you cannot hide them in your pockets or behind your back.

_NB: Sometimes the speaker can point not at the place he is talking about but at some other position so the audience would stay awake. **(check this one)**_


### Props

* Props are also pretty effective when we try to teach

* Empathatic mirroring - the audience can feel everything happening on the speaker's side like writing on the board or interacting with the props


### Slides


#### General recommendations

* Again, they are for exposing ideas rather than for teaching

* Usually they suffer from being way too long (too many slides) and way too wordy (too many words per slide).

* DON'T write too many words on the slide.

* Stay close to the presentation so the audience would not move their heads too much from the speaker to the presentation.

* Slides are condiments to what the speaker says, not the main thing.

#### Recommendations for the presentation itself

* In general - keep the reasonable amount of information on your slides

* Use a simple background for slides so the text would be readable (some plain color like white should be enough).

* Minimize the amount of words on slides and do not read from the slides.

* Logos and other clutter (_probably titles as well **(should be checked)**_) should be removed from your presentation

* A font size large enough can be used as a word count limiter. Somewhere around 35 can be just perfect (_**Check this statement as well**_).

#### Physical pointers (laser ones or wooden ones).

* Be careful using pointers. If you use pointers you tend to lose the contact with your audience.

* Instead of pointers incorporate some pointers in slides themselves. If you want to point at something on a slide put an arrow directly on the slides. E.g.: [this moment at the lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=31m39s).

#### Information saturation

* Sometimes slides suffer from way too much textual information on it.

* Leave some "air" in slides.

* Write text on your slide only when there is such a necessity. Like there is some quote of some historical significance.

* Let your audience read the text on the slide.

#### [An hapax legomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hapax_legomenon)

Use it with caution. E.g.: [the slide to demonstrate ridiculous complexity of something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=33m50s).


### How to inspire people

Exhibit passion about what you are doing. Otherwise the audience will not be interested in the talk and will not be inspired.


That applies to giving the promises in the beginning of the talk as well. E.g.: [this part](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&t=38m40s).


### Teach people how to think (applies when you teach others)

The talk should be a story. In order to make people start thinking we can tell them stories they need to know, the questions they need to ask about the stories, mechanisms for analyzing the stories, how to put the stories together, how to check the stories' reliability.


### Persuading

#### Oral exams

Most common reasons of failing oral exams
* Failure to situate - the talk is given without a context. That results that it is not clear why the talk is important.
* Failure to practice - the talk is given without a practice of talking to someone who doesn't know about what you are doing. That results that the listener who you practice your talk with and who is aware of what you are doing will hallucinate that there is something in your talk but there isn't.

The older the people are the better their understanding is where they are in the world. Young people tend to show old people how smart they are. If the commitee is pretty old that's what you want.

#### Job talks

It is important to demonstrate these two things:
* What is the vision
    1.  What is a problem to be resolved
    2.  What is your approach to resolve the problem
* What has been already done or should be done (if not yet).
* What exactly is your contribution.

The vision and the things done should be given in under 5 minutes (_**Sounds like an empirical measure. Check other sources.**_).



#### Getting famous

Why is it important? Because you get used to getting famous but you never get used to being ignored.
    
How exactly it can be done (5 S's):
* Have some kind of **symbol** associated with your work.
* Have some kind of **slogan** which provides a handle for your work.
* **Surprise** your audience.
* Provide some **salient idea**. It should not be an important idea but rather an idea which sticks out.
* Tell a **story** why something is important.

### How to stop the talk

#### Final slide

Bad examples of final slides:
1. "Collaborators" - this can lead to a conclusion that your part is really small, so it would be better to put this slide at the beginning of the talk.
2. "Questions?" - the slide can last for several minutes (up to 20 minutes) which could be used in a significantly better way.
3. "For details proceed to this link" or similar - Unless you share your slides online. Otherwise no one would be writing the link down.
4. "The end", "thank you" - see "Questions?" but besides that it just looks immature.
5. Conclusions - can show your conclusions no one cares about.


Good final slide should show what **you** have done. So instead of "Conclusions" it would make sense to put your "Contributions" onto the slide.

#### Final words

* It is fine to tell a joke in the end (or even in a middle of the talk) because people have got used to you as a speaker.

* Saying "Thank you" at the end would assume that it was a burden for the listeners to listen to you. It is not bad to say "Thank you" while getting a round of applause.

* Some other examples:
   1. Let the audience know that "the talk is over" by saying it directly.
   2. Salute the audience ("I am glad you have come to the talk and learned this, this and that").
